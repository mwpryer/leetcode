 *
 * A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top to represent the hours (0-11), and 6
 * LEDs on the bottom to representÂ the minutes (0-59). Each LED represents a
 * zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.
 *
 *
 * For example, the below binary watch reads "4:51".
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Given an integer turnedOn which represents the number of LEDs that are
 * currently on (ignoring the PM), return all possible times the watch could
 * represent. You may return the answer in any order.
 *
 * The hour must not contain a leading zero.
 *
 *
 * For example, "01:00" is not valid. It should be "1:00".
 *
 *
 * The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading
 * zero.
 *
 *
 * For example, "10:2" is not valid. It should be "10:02".
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: turnedOn = 1
 * Output:
 * ["0:01","0:02","0:04","0:08","0:16","0:32","1:00","2:00","4:00","8:00"]
 * Example 2:
 * Input: turnedOn = 9
 * Output: []
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 0 <= turnedOn <= 10
