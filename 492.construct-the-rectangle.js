 *
 * A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a
 * specific rectangular web page’s area, your job by now is to design a
 * rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following
 * requirements:
 *
 *
 * The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given
 * target area.
 * The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
 * The difference between length L and width W should be as small as
 * possible.
 *
 *
 * Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web
 * page you designed in sequence.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: area = 4
 * Output: [2,2]
 * Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it
 * are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1].
 * But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement
 * 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the
 * width W is 2.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: area = 37
 * Output: [37,1]
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: area = 122122
 * Output: [427,286]
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= area <= 10^7
 *
