 * Testcase Example:  '[2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19]\n[2,1,4,3,9,6]'
 *
 * Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, the elements of arr2 are distinct, and all
 * elements in arr2 are also in arr1.
 *
 * Sort the elements of arr1 such that the relative ordering of items in arr1
 * are the same as in arr2. Elements that do not appear in arr2 should be
 * placed at the end of arr1 in ascending order.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]
 * Output: [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: arr1 = [28,6,22,8,44,17], arr2 = [22,28,8,6]
 * Output: [22,28,8,6,17,44]
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000
 * 0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 1000
 * All the elements of arr2 are distinct.
 * EachÂ arr2[i] is in arr1.
